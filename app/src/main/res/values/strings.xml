    Video list auto playback made simple, specially built for RecyclerView

  <string name="basic_sample_1">
    Basic Sample 1: Minimal
  </string>

  <string name="basic_sample_1_description">
    \tIn this sample, we learn how to implement very simple Video ViewHolder and Video list and
    add Toro support into the App.\n\n
    \tThere are 2 types of components here: normal ViewHolder (shows no Videos) and video ViewHolder
    (will have a Video). Here we can see that by correctly implementing Toro\'s core components,
    we could reduce a lot of time on Video.
  </string>

  <string name="basic_sample_2">
    Basic Sample 2: Minimal, Ordered
  </string>

  <string name="basic_sample_2_description">
    \tThis basic example is similar to Basic Sample 1. Additionally, we have a feature to tell Toro
    which is the first Video we want to play.
    Until that Video is prepared and start playing, no other Videos is allowed to play.
  </string>

  <string name="basic_sample_3">
    Basic Sample 3: Minimal, Loop, Interaction
  </string>

  <string name="basic_sample_3_description">
    \tThis basic example is similar to Basic Sample 1. Additionally, we enable interaction with Video View.
    On single click, we temporarily pause the playback and show an AlertDialog, after we close that dialog, we resume the playback.
    We also provide custom feedback on long press too.
    \n\nFurthermore, we add the ability to selective react to click event: we have different response on the View user clicked.
  </string>

  <string name="average_sample_1">
    Average Sample 1: Custom, Stateful
  </string>

  <string name="average_sample_1_description">
    \tThis example is similar to Basic Sample 1. But we add more complicated state listening event.
    So that we could see how ToroPlayer\'s callback works in practice.
  </string>

  <string name="advance_sample_1">
    Advance Sample 1: Custom LayoutManager, Stateful playback
  </string>

  <string name="advance_sample_1_description">
    \tThis example is similar to Average Sample 1. This time, we use a custom LayoutManager
    (here I use CarouselLayoutManager) and implement ToroLayoutManager to get native support from Toro.
  </string>

  <string name="custom_sample_1">
    Custom Sample 1: Facebook + DialogFragment
  </string>

  <string name="custom_sample_1_description">
    \tThis example introduce a Facebook-alike timeline, with mixed contents of Text and Videos.
    A click event to a Video will bring a \'Video list\' where requested Video is played as well as
    many suggested Videos.

  <string name="extended_sample_1_description">
    \tIn this sample, we learn how to use the extended benefit or Toro.\n\n
    \tThe list will automatically scroll to next Player and trigger the playback.\n\n
    \tA long click is handled to support more ideas in your Application.
